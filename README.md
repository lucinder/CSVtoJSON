I *am* the creator of the input dataset, which uses data compiled from fishbase.org and creative common images from all over the internet. This dataset was originally created for usage in my [fishing minigame](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/63087fb7255ce49468d57ef4). You are welcome to use it however you want! <3
### Output JSON files will not be neatly formatted! Use a [JSON formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/) to make it look nice!
